# EESTEC Bucharest Event Website

This is my first project using **ReactJS**, created as a fictional website for a real event organized by **EESTEC Bucharest**. As a second-year student at the Faculty of Automation and Computer Science within **UNSTPB**, I wanted to explore front-end development and build a responsive website using modern web technologies.

## Technologies Used
- **ReactJS** (JavaScript library for building user interfaces)
- **HTML** (for structuring the content)
- **CSS** (for styling the website)

## Tools Used
- **Visual Studio Code** (as the code editor)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager for managing dependencies)

## Project Setup
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. npm install
3. npm start
4. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the website.
